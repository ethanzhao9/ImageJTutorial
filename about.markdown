My name is Ethan Zhao. I'm an undergraduate student in [Institute of Neuroscience] in Shanghai, China. My lab focus on optical neuroimaging.

I have been writing two columns, the Practical Tutorial of ImageJ([ImageJ实用教程]) and the Tutorial of ImageJ Development([ImageJ开发教程]), in Zhihu since 2019. But they are all written in Chinese.

Now I want to translate the columns to English in order to share to more people around the world.

You can find all the source code in my tutorial at GitHub:
